 [1] "subject"
 Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 
 Range from 1 to 30.
 
 [2] "activity" 
 The name of the activity performed by the subject.
         WALKING
         WALKING_UPSTAIRS
         WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
         SITTING           
         STANDING
         LAYING    
 The rest are the means of certain subject who performed certain activity measured by certain measurements.
 'time' means it is a time domain signal.
 'frequency' means a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to these signals.
 'Mean' and 'Standard deviation' indicates how the set of variables were estimated from signals.
 '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
